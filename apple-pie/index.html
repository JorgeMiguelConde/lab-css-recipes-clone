    Apple Pie:
    <br>
    <br>
    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well! 
    <br>           <br>

    Ingredients 
    <br>
    1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie 
    1/2 cup unsalted butter 
    3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
    1/4 cup water
    3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
    1/4 cup water 1/2 cup white sugar
    1/2 cup packed brown sugar
    8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
<br><br>
    Directions
<br><br>
    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
    <br>Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
<br>Stir in flour to form a paste. 
<br>Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
    to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. 
<br> Place the bottom crust in your pan. 
<br>Fill with apples, mounded
    slightly. 
    <br>Cover with a lattice work crust. 
    <br>Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. 
    <br>Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
<br>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. 
<br>Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
    degrees C). 
    <br>Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
